        Program 1
        {
            The purpose of the program is to track YouTube videos and comments added to them.
            This time we will focus on saving that information using methods such as lists.
            Abstraction is essential to achieving this goal.
        }

        Program 2
        {
            Creating a program to manage common online orders. Order information, customer information, etc. are stored and operated in separate classes, 
            so in order to prevent information from being mixed up due to unintended behavior, 
            member variables should be used only within that class by applying the principle of encapsulation. is the condition.
        }

        Program 3
        {
            Creating a program to plan and manage three different types of events. Each event has some common items in the data to be tracked, 
            but not all of them are the same, so it is best to set a base class, create basic information and methods, and inherit them.
            In the case of an outdoor event, a method that returns the weather forecast is required as data to be considered, 
            and if some performers are participating, a method that returns this additional information is required.
        }

        Program 4
        {
            Create a program that creates three different exercise records and calculates and returns overall results and various numerical values ​​based on the data obtained from them.
            Each exercise uses common elements such as distance and speed to record records, and in some cases the same calculation formula is used,
            so it is recommended to define attributes and methods using the principle of polymorphism and override them in each inherited class. It's perfect.
        }
    }
